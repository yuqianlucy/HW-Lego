## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Exercise 4: Create a new variable called age_group and group the ages into the following categories: “18 and under”, “19 - 25”, “26 - 35”, “36 - 50”, “51 and over”.
```{r}

      age>=36&age<=50  ~"36-50",
      age>=51~ "51 and over"
                        ))

```

# Which age group has purchased the highest number of Lego sets.

```{r}
lego_sales%>%
  group_by(age_group)%>%
  summarise(
    total_number=sum(quantity)

# The age group that purchaes highest number of Lego set are the group of: 36-50


#Exercise 6: Which age group has spent the most money on Legos?
